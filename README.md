# WEB-TRAFFIC-ANOMALY-DETECTION

# BACKGROUND

The background to the report on “Web Traffic Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques” is deeply rooted in the dependence on web servers and thus, the influx of web traffic. Increased usage of digital technologies has led to an increase in data sent through the internet for instance when a person searches websites or performs online transactions. This shift has seen an exponential growth in terms of information exchange and connectivity which has consequently given birth to IoT (Internet of Things) thereby allowing multiple online services.

However, there are also serious threats inherent in increased internet use. The rush on web servers also exposes them to different security risks including loss of data, distribution of malware and many other malicious behaviors. Web traffic anomalies such as immediate irregular changes in traffic patterns are a big challenge as they may point out probable security breaches or system failures. Real time anomaly detection and mitigation is necessary to maintain online systems’ integrity and security.Conventional methods for detecting abnormality like statistical analysis and rule-based systems usually fail at managing ever changing complexities associated with web traffic patterns; this often makes it difficult for them to detect sudden changes happening within already established patterns especially considering their dynamic nature.

# OBJECTIVE

This study aims at comparing and analyzing the efficiency of four deep learning architectures, namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (C-LSTM) in relation to web traffic anomaly detection. As a result, LSTM neural networks are able to identify long term dependencies in sequential data thus enabling them to be ideal for modeling complex patterns found in web traffic. Also, GRU based RNNs are good at identifying temporal relationships that are key when it comes to several evolving anomalies.
Moreover, this research uses GRU as well as C-LSTM models other than LSTM and RNN structures. In comparison to LSTM, GRU has a less complicated structure that could lead to shorter training times and better performance. Similarly, C-LSTM is an amalgamation of convolutional layers with LSTM networks that allow for extraction of spatial and temporal features from input data hence offering a holistic approach towards detecting the presence of anomalies in web traffic. The purpose of this research is therefore to evaluate these architectures extensively with a view of establishing the best model for real-time anomaly detection that can help enhance cybersecurity measures on online systems.

# SIGNIFICANCE

The significance of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (C-LSTM) architectures cannot be overemphasized in web traffic anomaly detection. Being recurrent models, RNNs are excellent in holding the sequential dependencies within data, which suits well for modeling the dynamic nature of web traffic. 
On the other hand, there exist LSTM networks that provide a solution for learning long-term dependence without falling into vanishing gradient problem as they improve recognition of complex patterns that exist within some data pertaining to web traffic. Sometimes GRUs could be used instead since they have simpler gating as compared to those of LSTM although they can still capture temporal dependencies. To this extent, C-LSTM networks combine convolutional layers with LSTM units so both spatial and temporal features can be extracted from web traffic data. This way, the combination enables the model to unveil intricate patterns contained in web traffic making it a stronger predictor of anomalies.
